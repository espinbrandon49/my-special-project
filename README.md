# CSS Code Snippets 
We built a responsive webpage to hold a collection of CSS snippets 

## Installation
Git clone - https://github.com/espinbrandon49/my-special-project

## Tools
HTML, CSS, Git and Github

## Description
You can view a collection of labeled CSS elements in a responsive grid that also allows for expansion.

The responsive grid uses flexbox so that it is easily viewed on different desktop screens as well as as phones and tablets.

* The webpage layout was wireframed
* We built our HTML skeleton and used semantic elements for accessibility
* The CSS was then introduced to visualize our barebones website initially only with borders around all of the boxes
* We made one card first and then when we were satisfied that it met the requirements, introduced the rest of the cards
* We then added the fixed dimensions and responsive properties (flexbox) in CSS
* We added the content to HTML and adjusted our CSS padding and margin elements as needed
* We finished with our decorative liner gradients and color theme
